    2->  What is CLI?
CLI stands for Command-Line Interface. It means your program will run in the terminal using text input/output (like your Password.py script).

No buttons or windows.

You type commands and see output as text.

MODELS-->
without mpdel-user = {"username": "mahi", "password": "123", "is_admin": False}. No rules, no methods, no clear structure.
with model-user = User("mahi", "123", False)
Defines what kind of data your app will use (users, questions, quizzes).
Makes sure every quiz has valid structure (e.g., a title and list of questions).
Has .to_dict() and .from_dict() methods so objects can be saved (e.g. to JSON).


to_dict()	Converts object → dictionary (for saving)
   q = Question("What is 2+2?", ["2", "3", "4"], "4")->Converts it into a plain dictionary like this:
{
    "id": "c37b...uuid...",
    "prompt": "What is 2+2?",
    "options": ["2", "3", "4"],
    "answer": "4",
    "q_type": "mcq"
You can’t directly save class objects like Question into JSON or text files.
json.dump() works only with dictionaries and lists, not objects.
to_dict() makes the object storable and transferrable.
}

from_dict()	Converts dictionary → object (for loading)...
Takes a dictionary like:
{
    "prompt": "What is 2+2?",
    "options": ["2", "3", "4"],
    "answer": "4",
    "q_type": "mcq"
}Returns a new Question object->q = Question("What is 2+2?", ["2", "3", "4"], "4", "mcq")

✅ Structure	Defines what kind of data your app will use (users, questions, quizzes).

1->importing the models
2-> creating the models
    creating user class,inititating the constructor then convert the user object to dictionary then
     using the static returns data from json
    Creating the question and quiz and converting the object into dictionary file to_dict and from_dict
     ✅ to_dict(self) — Converts an object into a dictionary
     ✅ from_dict(data) — Converts a dictionary back into an object


3-> creating the FILE OP method  [data is actually saved to and loaded from the disk using JSON files]
    models.py classes (User, Quiz) provide:
     .to_dict()→convert objects to dictionaries(stored JSON)..from_dict() →convert dictionaries back into objects (usable in Python).
    This file operation code uses those methods to:
     Save Python objects (User, Quiz) into files.Load them back from files as Python objects.
